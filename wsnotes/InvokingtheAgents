Invoking the Agents
In this section, you will test the Orchestrator-Agent and observe how it intelligently routes different types of queries to specialized agents through the AWS Bedrock Console.

Instructions
Navigate to the Agent Testing Interface:

Go to the Amazon Bedrock Agents page 
Locate and select "Orchestrator-Agent"
Click the Test button to launch the testing interface
Test Store Operations Queries:

Enter the following sample questions:
1
What is the address of Octank Pet Store?

1
What are the store hours for Octank Pet Store?

1
What is Pet Store's return policy?

Observe how the Orchestrator-Agent routes these queries to the KB-Agent
Verify that responses come from the knowledge base documents
Test Breed Information Requests:

Try queries about dog breeds:
1
List top 20 dog breeds available

1
Tell me about the characteristics of Golden Retrievers

Watch how the Orchestrator-Agent:
Identifies this as a breed information request
Routes to the Rest-API-Agent
Returns detailed breed information
Test Inventory Queries:

Submit inventory-related questions:
1
Could you show me what pets we have and what types of animals they are?

1
Could you display all the pet categories?

Observe the process as the Orchestrator-Agent:
Routes to the Query-Generation-Agent
Converts the request to SQL
Returns current inventory data
Analyze Agent Responses:

For each query, examine:
Which specialized agent was selected
The reasoning behind the routing decision
Processing steps taken
Notes
When testing the agent system, start with simple, clear questions and gradually increase complexity. Pay attention to the Orchestrator-Agent's explanations of its routing decisions, which will help you understand the system's decision-making process. For detailed information about agent testing, consult the Amazon Bedrock Agents documentation .
